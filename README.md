1. I created a travel site for going to Utah. I chose this topic because I went to Utah over winter breack and thought it would be interesting to combine all of the different things I researched and put them in one place (ie. ski rentals, places to visit). I used different div, a table, added links, an image, image map, css styling, and headers. An aspect that I added that we did not cover in class is emojis.
